** Some text =code=

*** Additional details

    This is a paragraph of long-form text, just in case you want to

    This is a second paragraph just to make sure the paragraph parsing
    and rendering works.

** More text

*** Some sub-items

    This is some text with *emphasis* and _underlined_ portions. Also
    /italics/!

    We also want to support math $\int_\alpha^\beta f(x)\ dx$, but
    that seems unlikely.

*** More sub-items

** Yet more text
